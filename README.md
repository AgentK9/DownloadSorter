# DownloadSorter
This is a quick script I threw together because I didn't like how my Downloads folder was filling up. All that has to be done for it to be triggered (on MacOS at least) every time a file goes into your downloads folder is to create a new folder action in automator and set it to run this script via ```bash swift /path/to/main.swift```.
